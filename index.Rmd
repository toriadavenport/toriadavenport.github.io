Hello!

My name is Toria Davenport, and I am a junior Psychology major at Appalachian State University with a concentration in human services and minors in statistics and social work. I aspire to get my master's degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and work as a behavioral techniction until I can become a Licensed Professional Counselor. 

In general, my research interests include psychotherapy outcome and processes, child and adoloscent psychopathology, neurological bases of psychotherapy and psychopathology, and more. I hope that I can also use advanced data analysis methods to score assessments/evaluations and also for general research purposes. </center>
